# Student's repository for the "DevOps with Docker" course 🔁🐳

Repository for the "DevOps with Docker" course, from the University of Helsinki, that I've taken. It contains the exercises done and also some files created during the lessons.

I finshed this course on **2023-12-09**. I've studied all the sections, but I haven't done some exercises because I didn't see much point in doing them.
