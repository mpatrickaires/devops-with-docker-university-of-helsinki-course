# EXERCISE 1.6: HELLO DOCKER HUB
Run `docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise`.

It will wait for your input. Navigate through Docker hub to find the docs and Dockerfile that was used to create the image.

Read the Dockerfile and/or docs to learn what input will get the application to answer a "secret message".

Submit the secret message and command(s) given to get it as your answer.

## Solution

From the [image's overview page in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise):

> This is the readme, use input "basics" to complete this exercise.

Using the input "basics", we get that the secret message is **"This is the secret message"**.
